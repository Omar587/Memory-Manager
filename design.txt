For this project I have made an  interesting design decision. For one when mymalloc is called, I simply keep on splitting the one free chunk at the end of the list, only if there is no available exact chunk.
If there is a free chunk  available of the exact size then mymalloc will allocate that space and mark that chunk as used.

My justification for this is because it makes the memory map more neat. It will be easier to follow how the chunk is being split.


freeHelper.c contains helper functions that are essential for myFree
mallocHelper.c conttains helper functions that are essential for myMalloc

memManager.c has the functions myMalloc and myFree they make use of the helper functions.
in this file. It contains a test function where the user has the ability to make myMalloc and myFree calls
